<h3 class="h3">What's a QR Code?</h3>
<p class="lead">
    A QR Code, short for Quick Response Code, is a two-dimensional barcode that contains encoded information. It was first developed in 1994 by a Japanese automotive company, Denso Wave, as a way to track vehicles during the manufacturing process. Since then, QR Codes have gained popularity and are now widely used for various purposes.

<h5 class="h5">How does a QR Code work?</h5>
<p class="lead">
    A QR Code consists of black squares arranged on a white background. The arrangement of these squares forms a unique pattern that can be scanned and interpreted by QR Code readers or scanning apps. When a QR Code is scanned, the encoded information within it is decoded and can trigger a specific action or provide relevant information.
